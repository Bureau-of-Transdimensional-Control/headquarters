# Bureau of Transdimensional Control

In the early 1970s, strange reports began surfacing across the United States—whispers of unexplained events that went far beyond ordinary crime or even Cold War espionage. Deeply concerned but unsure of the scope or source of these phenomena, federal authorities sought a provisional solution. Thus, the Bureau of Transdimensional Control was hastily formed as an interagency team of specialists, brought together under a shared mandate to investigate and neutralize emergent threats.

A Cautious Commitment

- Limited Resources, High Stakes: Although the anomalies seemed alarming, the government was hesitant to commit large-scale support without undeniable proof of their origin or danger. The BTC, therefore, operates on a lean budget and minimal public scrutiny.
- Interagency Collaboration: An eclectic mix of federal, state, and local personnel staff the BTC—FBI detectives, CDC epidemiologists, CIA analysts, National Guard medics, Forest Service rangers, and more. This interagency model ensures rapid deployment and specialized skill sets while keeping oversight decentralized.
- Experimental Authority: Since the Bureau’s mission stretches beyond conventional law enforcement or military operations, its legal and operational frameworks are still evolving. BTC agents are granted just enough authority to do their jobs, but official policy remains vague and reactive.

Mission and Scope

- Identify Emerging Anomalies: Whether it’s a mysterious outbreak in a small-town hospital or a series of bizarre incidents on federal land, BTC agents are dispatched to observe, analyze, and determine the threat level.
- Contain and Suppress: When these incidents threaten public safety—or risk attracting too much attention—the Bureau acts swiftly, often imposing quarantines or setting up cover stories. The priority is preventing widespread alarm.
- Gather Evidence: The BTC compiles data, artifacts, and testimonies, hoping to build a comprehensive understanding of these phenomena. Hard evidence could eventually unlock more robust governmental backing.

Culture and Challenges

- Make-Do Mentality: Agents often work with outdated equipment and limited funding. Ingenuity, resourcefulness, and interdepartmental contacts become the keys to success.
- Secrecy and Credibility: The government hasn’t fully acknowledged the reality of transdimensional or paranormal threats. BTC personnel must walk a fine line, handling sensitive investigations while keeping curious officials and the media at bay.
- Psychological Toll: Working on these unsettling cases can be psychologically taxing, leaving agents isolated. Official support for their mental health is minimal—at least until more concrete evidence demands a larger commitment.

At its core, the Bureau of Transdimensional Control represents a tenuous first step toward confronting a danger no one fully understands. It stands at the crossroads between skepticism and necessity, with a mandate to protect the public—even if the public never learns the truth behind the horrors lurking just out of sight.

# BTC Headquarters: The Old Malted Marvel Brewery

Nestled in a run-down industrial stretch of St. Louis, the Old Malted Marvel Brewery stands as an unassuming relic of the city’s brewing heyday. Its faded brick walls and boarded windows keep prying eyes at bay, masking the discreet renovations within. Official records list the site as a government “storage facility,” but those who have clearance know it to be the newly established headquarters of the Bureau of Transdimensional Control (BTC).

Inside, the gutted brewing vats have been converted into secure research labs and evidence vaults, while the dusty bottling hall now serves as a makeshift administrative office. Thick stone corridors beneath the main floor—originally used to regulate temperature—provide secretive tunnels ideal for storing sensitive materials or housing unexpected finds. Faint echoes of dripping water mix with the ever-present hum of covert activity, reminding every agent that the Bureau’s mission transcends ordinary law enforcement.

Despite the building’s utilitarian makeover, remnants of its past linger. The pungent whiff of aged yeast still clings to the walls, and old signage bearing half-rusted brewery logos pokes through the newly placed security gates. This blend of industrial history and clandestine research fosters an atmosphere equal parts forgotten ruin and hidden fortress—an apt stage for the BTC’s tireless pursuit of the unexplained.
